# CanJS-ColorChooser
Simple Web Color Chooser to Demonstrate CanJS Capabilities
(CanJS information is found at http://canjs.com)

This web app is running at http://colors.code-read.com.

It is my first framework-based web app.  I would like to improve it, 
and ***welcome your constructive criticism***.  Of particular concern:

1. I feel it relies too heavily on global variables to share information between
ViewModels.

2. I would like to create a <final-el> VM to handle grid cell properties rather than
rely on indexes in my element ID's.  For more detail see "todo: <final-el>" in index.html.

3. I want to play a sound effect when the user hovers over a grid cell, but so far
the sound lags so far behind the visual display that this degrades rather than
improves the user experience (see "todo: address lag" in index.html).

Thanks for looking!
